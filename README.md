# My version of the very popular wordle game 
How to Play:
You enter your name at the beginning.
The game picks a random word from a list.
You have 6 guesses to figure out the word.
After each guess, youâ€™ll receive color-coded feedback to help you improve your next guess.
Whether you win or lose, you can play multiple rounds!
